== ArangoDB APIs
You'll often jump straight into the web interface or `arangosh` to do quick searches, but you will eventually also want to access that data from you analysis software, i.c. R. Most database systems have drivers for R, including ArangoDB: see https://gitlab.com/krpack/arango-driver[here]. The same is true for python (multiple libraries even, including https://github.com/saeschdivara/ArangoPy[ArangoPy] and https://github.com/Joowani/python-arango[python-arango]) and https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs[javascript], for example.

=== ArangoDB and R
See the links for documentation on how to use ArangoDB from R and other languages. Just as an illustration: here's a document query in R:
[source,R]
----
all.cities <- cities %>% all_documents()
all.persons <- persons %>% all_documents()

if(all.cities$London$getValues()$capital){
  print("London is still the capital of UK")
} else {
  print("What's happening there???")
}
----

And a graph query:

[source,R]
----
london.residence <- residenceGraph %>%
  traversal(vertices = c(all.cities$London), depth = 2)
london.residence %>% visualize()
----

will return:
