So some key concepts in relational database design:

- relational database = collection of tables
- table = collection of columns (attributes) describing a relation
- tuple = row of data in the table
- attribute = a characteristic or descriptor of tuples
- primary key = a unique identifier for a tuple. This can be a single column, or a collection of columns.
