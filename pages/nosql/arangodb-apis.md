You'll often jump straight into the web interface or `arangosh` to do quick searches, but you will eventually also want to access that data from you analysis software, i.c. R. Most database systems have drivers for R, including ArangoDB: see [here](https://gitlab.com/krpack/arango-driver). The same is true for python (multiple libraries even, including [ArangoPy](https://github.com/saeschdivara/ArangoPy) and [python-arango](https://github.com/Joowani/python-arango)) and [javascript](https://github.com/arangodb/arangojs), for example.
