In a way, document stores are similar to key/value stores. You could think of the automatically generated key in the document store to resemble the key in the key/value store, and the rest of the document being the value. However, there _is_ a major difference: in key/value stores, documents can only be retrieved using their key and the documents are not searchable themselves. In contrast, the key in document stores is almost never used explicitely of even seen.
