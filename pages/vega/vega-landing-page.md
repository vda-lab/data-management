As for the [vega-lite tutorial], make sure to have the [documentation webpage](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/) open. The other important websites are:

- [vega website](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
- [examples](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/)
- [tutorials](https://vega.github.io/vega/tutorials/)

Compared to vega-lite, vega provides more fine-grained control for composing interactive graphics, but is therefore also much more verbose. Whereas vega-lite provides decent defaults for, for example, scales and axes, this need to be made explicit in vega.
