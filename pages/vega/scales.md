Scales (see their documentation [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/)) convert data from the original domain to a range that can be used for plotting. For example, imagine you have longitude data from a map. Locations on the earth have a longitude that is between -180 and 180. We want to plot this on a graph that is 800 pixels wide. If we'd just use the longitude for the `x` value, than any location west of Greenwich would be outside of the plot (because smaller than zero), and most of the right of the graphic would be empty (because there are no points in the range -180 to 800). We need to recalculate the positions: -180 (degrees) needs to become 0 (pixels), 0 (degrees) needs to become 400 (pixels) and 180 (degrees) needs to become 800 (pixels).

Example data:
```json
{"name": "Thigpen", "city": "Bay Springs", "state": "MS", "country": "USA", "lat": 31.95376472, "long": -89.23450472}
{"name": "Livingston Municipal", "city": "Livingston", "state": "TX", "country": "USA", "lat": 30.68586111, "long": -95.01792778}
{"name": "Meadow Lake", "city": "Colorado Springs", "state": "CO", "country": "USA", "lat": 38.94574889, "long": -104.5698933}
{"name": "Perry-Warsaw", "city": "Perry", "state": "NY", "country": "USA", "lat": 42.74134667, "long": -78.05208056}
{"name": "Hilliard Airpark", "city": "Hilliard", "state": "FL", "country": "USA", "lat": 30.6880125, "long": -81.90594389}
```

The most important keys for a scale are its `domain` and its `range`. The `domain` is the original space; the `range` is the target range. In the case of the longitude data:

A `scale` also needs to have a name so that it can be referenced later. This is what the most simple scale for the conversion of  looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "myscale",
  "type": "linear",
  "domain": [-180,180],
  "range": [0,800]
},
```

The `linear` type of scale interpolates the target value linearly. The `domain` provides the minimum and maximum values of the source values; the `range` provides the minimum and maximum of the target values. To use this scale, we reference it in the encoding: `"x": {"scale": "myscale", "field": "longitude"}`.

Instead of providing a minimum and maximum value for `domain` or `range`, we can also provide just a single number which is then considered the maximum. This is what you see in the example above for `xscale`: `"range": "width"`.

Different types of scales exist, including `linear`, `sqrt`, `ordinal` etc. See the documentation at [https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#types](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#types) for a full reference.

Scales are not only interesting for recalculating ranges, but they are used to assign colours to categories as well. We'll come back to those later.
