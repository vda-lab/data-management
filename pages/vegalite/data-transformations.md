Sometimes we'll want to do some calculations on the data before we actually visualise them. For example, we want to make a barchart that shows the average miles per gallon for each number of cylinders. Basically, we'll have to add a `transform` part to our specification:

```json
{
  "data": ...,
  "transform": ...,
  "mark": ...,
  "encoding": ...
}
```

There is extensive documentation available for these transforms at [https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/transform.html](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/transform.html). Possible transformations that we can apply are: aggregate, bin, calculate, density, filter, flatten, fold, impute, join aggregate, lookup, pivot, quantile, regression and loess regression, sample, stack, time unit, and window.

In the case of _filtering_, it is quite clear what will happen: only the objects that match will be displayed. We can for example show a barchart of acceleration only for those cars that have 5 or fewer cylinders. One of the problems that we run into, is that the specification needs to be in JSON format. To say that we only want cars with 5 or fewer cylinders, we'll use `"filter": {"field": "Cylinders", "lte": "5"}`. The `lte` stands for "less than or equal to". There is also:
- `equal`
- `lt` (less than)
- `gt` (great than)
- `gte` (greater than or equal to)
- `range`
- `oneOf`

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "transform": [
    {
      "filter": {"field": "Cylinders", "lte": "5"}
    }
  ],
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "Cylinders", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "Acceleration", "type": "quantitative"},
    "size": {"value": 20}
  }
}
```

Another option is to use a filter like this: `{"filter": "datum.Cylinders <= 5"}` where `datum` stands for a single object, and `.Cylinders` will get the value for that property.

Both will give the following image:

A filter does not change the data objects itself. This is different for many other transformations. For example, we can `calculate` as well. For example, the "Year" attribute in each object is now a string, e.g. "1970-01-01". It'd be good if this would be a number. We'll need to look into vega _expressions_ on how to do this [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/expressions/). There seem to be [date-time functions](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/expressions/#datetime-functions), we it appears we can extract the year with `year(datum.Year)`.

What does this do? _This effectively adds a new field to each object, called `yearonly`_. We can now use this new field as any other.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "transform": [
      {"calculate": "year(datum.Year)", "as": "yearonly"}
  ],
  "mark": "point",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "Miles_per_Gallon", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "Acceleration", "type": "quantitative"},
    "color": {"field": "yearonly", "type": "ordinal"}
  }
}
```

**Exercise** - Create an image that plots the original `Year` versus the new `yearonly`.

So with calculations, we get an additional field. What if we want to _aggregate_? Let's go back to our initial question: we want to have a barchart that shows the average miles per gallon for each number of cylinders. Below is the specification:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "transform": [
    {
      "aggregate": [{
         "op": "mean",
         "field": "Acceleration",
         "as": "mean_acc"
      }],
      "groupby": ["Cylinders"]
    }
  ],
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "Cylinders", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "mean_acc", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```

In the documentation, we see that `aggregate` takes a `AggregatedFieldDef[]`, and `groupby` takes a `String[]`. The `[]` after each of these indicates that they should be _arrays_, not single values. That is why we use `"aggregate": [{...}]` instead of `"aggregate": {...}` and `"groupby": ["Cylinders"]` instead of `"groupby": "Cylinders"`.

**Exercise** - See if you can create a plot that shows the mean acceleration per year. So you'll have to combine two transforms to do this. Your output picture should look like this:

  },
  "transform": [
    { "calculate": "year(datum.Year)", "as": "yearonly" },
    {
      "aggregate": [{
         "op": "mean",
         "field": "Acceleration",
         "as": "mean_acc"
      }],
      "groupby": ["yearonly"]
    }
  ],
  "mark": "line",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "yearonly", "type": "ordinal"},
    "y": {"field": "mean_acc", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}

As another example, let's create a histogram of the miles per gallon. Looking at the documentation at [https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/bin.html](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/bin.html), it seems that the easiest way to do this is to do this in the `encoding` section:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"bin": true, "field": "Miles_per_Gallon", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"aggregate": "count", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```

The only thing to do was to add `"bin": true` to the field that you want to bin, and `"aggregate": "count"` to the other dimension. However, this approach is not very flexible, and for any use that is not this straightforward you will have to define the binning as a `transform` instead, like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "transform": [
    {"bin": true, "field": "Miles_per_Gallon", "as": "binned_mpg"}
  ],
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "binned_mpg", "bin": {"binned": true,"step": 1},"type": "quantitative"},
    "x2": {"field": "binned_mpg_end"},
    "y": {"aggregate": "count", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```

When defining `bin` in a transform, it will create two new fields for each object: `binned_mpg` and `binned_mpg_end`. These indicate the boundaries of the bin that that object fits into. For example, the object

```json
{
   "Name":"chevrolet chevelle malibu",
   "Miles_per_Gallon":18,
   "Cylinders":8,
   "Displacement":307,
   "Horsepower":130,
   "Weight_in_lbs":3504,
   "Acceleration":12,
   "Year":"1970-01-01",
   "Origin":"USA"
}
```

becomes

```json
{
   "Name":"chevrolet chevelle malibu",
   "Miles_per_Gallon":18,
   "Cylinders":8,
   "Displacement":307,
   "Horsepower":130,
   "Weight_in_lbs":3504,
   "Acceleration":12,
   "Year":"1970-01-01",
   "Origin":"USA",
   "binned_mpg": 15,
   "binned_mpg_end": 20
}
```

Yet another way of creating a histogram is to work with two transforms: one to bin the data, and one to count the number of elements in the bin. This basically takes the output of the binning transform (i.e. the new `binned_mpg` field from above) and calculates the count on that. This way, the encoding is simpler to understand and we don't have to do magic incantations within the definition of `x` and `y`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/data/cars.json"
  },
  "transform": [
    {"bin": true, "field": "Miles_per_Gallon", "as": "binned_mpg"},
    {
      "aggregate": [{
         "op": "count",
         "field": "binned_mpg",
         "as": "count_mpg"
      }],
      "groupby": ["binned_mpg"]
    }
  ],
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "binned_mpg","type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "count_mpg", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```
