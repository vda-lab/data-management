As mentioned in the previous post, NoSQL is not about not using SQL, but about picking the right _combination_ of database architectures.

We've seen that NoSQL is about a set of concepts that allow the rapid and efficient processing of datasets with a focus on performance, reliability and agility. Core themes are that these solutions:

- are free of joins
- are schema-free
- work on many processors
- can use shared-nothing commodity computers
- support linear scalability

To clarify this a bit more, we'll dig a bit deeper into some of the central NoSQL concepts again.
