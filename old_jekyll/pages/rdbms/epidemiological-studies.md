Epidemiology is described as "the study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related states or events in specified populations, including the study of determinants influencing such states, and the application of this knowledge to control the health problems" (Dictionary of Epidemiology, Porta 2008). It covers a very broad and diverse line of research:
- experimental vs observational studies
- within the observational studies:
    - exploratory vs descriptive
    - exposure vs outcome oriented
The collected data can also be very diverse, and include questionnaires, forms, medical device outcomes, biological data, etc.

Epidemiological studies are generally done in one of two settings: primary (based on newly collected data) or secondary (using existing databases).

Generally a codebook or data dictionary that describes all data sources (collected, derived, transformed, ...). An example of a data dictionary is provided below (taken from Ahrens, W. et al. (2014): Handbook of epidemiology. Table 27.2).
