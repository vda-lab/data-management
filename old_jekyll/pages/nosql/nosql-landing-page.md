![NoSQL Distilled]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/nosql_distilled_book.jpg)

As described in Sadalage and Fowler's book "NoSQL Distilled", RDBMS have definitely proven their worth since the 1980s. Some of their strengths include:

- they can store large amounts of data that are easily queryable
- transactional mechanisms make concurrency safe: different individuals/systems can access a database at the same time and alter data without fear of corrupting that data
- SQL: a (almost) standard query language that is supported by all database management systems

There are however shortcomings of RDBMS, which we will describe in the following pages.
