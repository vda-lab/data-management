Data management is critical in any science, including biology. In this course, we will focus on relational (SQL) databases (RDBMS) as these are the most common. If time permits we might venture into the world of NoSQL databases (_e.g._ MongoDB, ArangoDB, neo4j) to allow storing of huge datasets.

For relational databases, we will discuss the basic concepts (tables, tuples, columns, queries) and explain the different normalisations for data. There will also be an introduction on writing SQL queries. Document-oriented and other NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB) can often also be accessed through either an interactive shell and/or APIs (application programming interfaces) in languages such as perl, ruby, java, clojure, ...
